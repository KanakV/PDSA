'''
Write a function named longest_decreasing_subsequence that takes a 
list L as input and returns the length of the longest decreasing 
subsequence (LDS). A decreasing subsequence is a sequence of elements from the 
list such that each element is smaller than the previous one. For example: 

If the input list is [20, 15, 8, 12, 2], the longest decreasing subsequences 
are [20, 15, 8, 2] or [20, 15, 12, 2], and the function should return 4. 

If the input list is [9, 7, 4, 3], the output should be 4. 

The function should efficiently calculate and return the length of 
the longest decreasing subsequence.
