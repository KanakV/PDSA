Sort all the edges of the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.
Create a new empty set for the minimum spanning tree (MST).
Iterate through the sorted edges, starting with the edge with the smallest weight.
For each edge, check if adding it to the MST will create a cycle.
If the edge does not create a cycle, add it to the MST.
Repeat steps 4 and 5 until all vertices are included in the MST, or until the desired number of edges have been added.
Return the MST.
