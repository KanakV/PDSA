Choose any vertex as the starting vertex and add it to the MST set. Initialize the weight of this vertex to 0.
Find the edge with the minimum weight that connects the starting vertex to any other vertex.
Add the adjacent vertex connected by the minimum weight edge to the MST set. Set its weight to the weight of the edge.
Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all vertices are included in the MST set.
